                <h3 class="indentp">WWGWS was designed based around global warming. The project evolved into a "world health" type game.</h3><br/>
                <h2 class="sub-header">How did WWGWS come into being?</h2>
                <h3 class="indentp">Well, I wanted money. Honestly, we all need money, but I would like to keep my reasons private. I first came up with a topic. Simple, I remembered somethjing that was brought up in science earlier, and decided on global warming. Then I began thinking of game mechanics that I could build around the topic of global warming. Why not try to combat the evil humans' plot to destroy the planet? Too abstract. It was at that point I remembered that in Democracy 3, there was an icon for global warming. Why not use a D3 like interface for playing? But when I thought about it, that would only work for a single country. How would it work, in this way, to manage the entire worlds' situation? I thought about it, and decided it would just have to. The game would take place from the perspective of a single country, of choice, and then one would have to work through negotioations and stuff in order to reduce the risk of global destruction. After that I began thinking of all of the factors I could use in the game, but quickly ran into a problem. The game would be pretty straight-forward if you just had to solve the problems in place. Very linear. So, why not have events. I wracked my brain to try and think of something major that could happen that would increase the time to the end of the game, and keep it interesting. Scientific discoveries! Say someone puts lead in gas and realizes it makes less noise than normal gas (this really happened). Then it pollutes the air and slowly kills everyone in contact with leaded gasoline. That would decrease the productivity of workers within the game, so having certain policies carried out will take longer. People will also start being sent to the hospitals and the government will have to pay. This money is then taken from the government. I then decided that the game would be somewhat related to D3. I wouldn't want to clone it, and I don't intend to. Therefore, I decided on the role of the player in the mix. The player is the head of the imaginary Department of Sanitation, Pollution and Contamination Control, or SPCC. This department manages contaminated materials and the prevention of pollution by the nation. It also deals with the Department of Foreign affairs and makes deals with other countries concerning the world-wide spread of pollution. Now then, where was I? The department gets its funding from the government based on the results it produces and the current affairs. Some ideas I came up with were federal loans based on the players current reputation, conducting research into the possible outcomes of new technologies and products, a news / newspaper system for getting headlines and text, and a policy system, where new policies can be implemented, such as the building of charging stations for electric cars, funding scientific research into the development of alternative, clean fuel sources. I also thought about the relations with other countries. If war broke out and someone dropped a nuke, everyone pays the price. The radioactive dust would spread throughout the atmosphere, and thereby affect every country (albeit differently based on where it is dropped in relation to the country). </h3><br/>
