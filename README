This is my personal website and portfolio. This repo also contains several python scripts I use for managing the website.

## Scripts
- server.py - a simple webserver for local development
- minify.py - minifies JS and CSS files from x.css and x.js to x.min.css and x.min.js
- compile.py - script for statically compiling HTML files from HTML_SRC and INC. Custom tags allow features such as embedding an HTML file into another (copied into the page to avoid iframes).
